plus a very heavily customized vim. 

Install
-------

 - clone repository into .vim
 - run rake init setup:plugins from .vim folder
 - win

Directory Structure
-------------------

*after*(/plugin/keymaps.vim): All custom key maps are in here, so that they get priority over plugins
*autoload*: pathogen (plugin management system) is installed here
*backup*: location for all vim temp files
*bundle*: All plugins are installed here as git submodules

vimrc
-----

vimrc is basically just a bootstrap file that will load each of the following files

*settings.vim*: editor config
*plugin-config*: keymaps and settings
*autocmds.vim*: autocmds and a few functions
*statusline.vim*: bunch of customizations for the modeline (lifted from scrooloose's vimrc)
*keymaps.vim*: link to bundle/plugin/keymaps.vim for convenience

ProTips
-------

 - keymaps file is extensive and well commented
 - to install a plugin, do git submodule init <git path> bundle/<plugin-name>
 - to delete a plugin, just remove it from the bundle directory, and check for any mentions of it in plugin-config.vim
