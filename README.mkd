Install
-------

 - clone repository into .vim
 - cd ~/.vim
 - rake init plugin:setup

Directory Structure
-------------------

 - *after*(/plugin/keymaps.vim): All custom key maps are in here, so that they get priority over plugins
 - *backup*: location for all vim temp files
 - *bundle*: All plugins are installed here by Vundle

vimrc
-----

vimrc is basically just a bootstrap file that will load each of the following files

 - *settings.vim*: editor config
 - *plugin-config*: keymaps and settings
 - *autocmds.vim*: autocmds and a few functions
 - *statusline.vim*: bunch of customizations for the modeline (lifted from scrooloose's vimrc)
 - *keymaps.vim*: link to bundle/plugin/keymaps.vim for convenience

ProTips
-------

 - keymaps file is extensive and well commented
